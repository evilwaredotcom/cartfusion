#### PREREQUISTES ####

1. ColdFusion Server running on a Windows Operating System.
2. Access to process <CFOBJECT>.
3. Administrator rights to configure the server.



#### INSTALLATION ###

1. Copy ssleay32.dll AND libeay32.dll to the %ROOT%/system32 directory (C:\WINNT\system32\).
2. Copy LPICOM_6_0.dll to the %ROOT%/system32 directory (C:\WINNT\system32\).
3. Register the LPICOM_6_0.dll. (regsvr32 c:\winnt\system32\lpicom_6_0.dll)



#### USING THE PROVIDED SAMPLE CODE ####

1. All samples rely upon the following templates to process correctly and should all be loaded into the same directory:
	
	a. application.inc (This contains your account specific information).
	b. FormatOutput.cfm (This contains a formated table output of the return variables for ease of reading).
	c. lpcfm.cfm (This file builds the XML to be sent, DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE).
	d. status.cfm (This file processes the transactions and sets the responses for output. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE).

2. Once the above files are uploaded to your server, you can process any of the other sample files included. 
3. For a real world sample of form input and output use, SAMPLE_SALE.htm which relies on SAMPLE_SALE.cfm to process.



#### NOTE ####

You can easily remove the include for FormatOutput.cfm and replace the output results in your own format. Available return variables are below. 

The include call can be found at the end of each sample script except for SHIPPING.cfm which does not rely on this file.
