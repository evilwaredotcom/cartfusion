The Cascade has the Comfort Glide Suspension System. This adjustment system will allow you to adjust to that perfect point. The SoftEdge shoulder straps have 2 layers of foam to give you maximum comfort and adjust. The modular waist belts have 3 layers of foam (a stiff outer layer, a firm middle layer, and a soft inner layer) for maximum load carrying capabilities combined with the ultimate in comfort. The Air Mesh on the inside of the belt stretches with the foam so there are no wrinkles to rub against your body. With ALPS Mountaineering internals, you&rsquo;re not going to have to purchase the pack and all kinds of accessories. The rain cover is INCLUDED and is now part of your pack &hellip; conveniently stored in a pocket at the bottom of your pack. Don&rsquo;t worry about buying a fanny pack for those quick hikes away from camp either because the top pocket converts to a fanny pack. When you&rsquo;re ready for your trip and your pack is full, but you still have a few things to take, don&rsquo;t worry! The top of the Cascade extends with a spindrift collar, so you can &ldquo;over pack.&rdquo; The top pocket adjusts up and down to keep it in the correct position and we&rsquo;ve included an &ldquo;Over the Top&rdquo; compression strap to stabilize your extra gear.
