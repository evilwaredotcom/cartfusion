It also provides the security of being able to pack a backup on that hunting trip hundreds of miles from civilization. Regardless, the Defender-Mag Combo is a cost effective and efficient way to own two high-performance crossbows with one simple purchase &ndash; an industry first. The Defender-Mag three-piece combo comes with our precision crafted 6 Point Series stock assembly fitted with our patented 3.5-pound PowerTouch-6 trigger and your choice of the patented ACUdraw or ACU-draw 50 cocking mechanism. In a matter of minutes, you can attach the Combo&rsquo;s 330 fps, 175-pound Defender CLS bow assembly or its 335 fps, 200- pound GT Mag bow assembly. Regardless of the bow assembly you choose at the time, you can be confident you will experience a profoundly satisfying hunting and shooting experience. <br><br>TenPoint&rsquo;s 3x Pro-View Scope:Calibrated for crossbows that shoot in the 300 fps range, this 20, 30, and 40-yard combo illuminated dot and crosshair configuration is housed in a lightweight seven-inch aluminum tube equipped with fully-coated 3X optics. The dots are positioned at the intersection of each duplex crosshair. Depending on your hunting conditions, you can choose from a non-illuminated black dot or one of two illuminated, colored dots (red or green). A five-position rheostat controls the light intensity and color. 7/8-inch scope mounting rings included. <br><br>The Original ACUdraw:The Premier Cocking Aid available today, converts even the heaviest draw weight to about five pounds of effort. It draws the bow accurately every time. Unlike other crossbow cocking mechanisms, it is lightweight and has no bulky clamp-on assemblies or hang-on accessories.
