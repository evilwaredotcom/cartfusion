The answer is always the same; ""It is practically impossible get uncomfortable with this rest"".<br><br>Quieter - Not having to use your legs as a gun rest allows the hunter to have a greater range of motion (shooting area). With this the hunter is a lot quieter because he or she does not have to position their lower body (knees) to support the gun. This also allows the hunter to have a 180-degree range of motion. A right-handed shooter could actually shoot their gun left-handed.<br><br>Compact - The Lazy Leg becomes a part of the gun. Although it is folded underneath the barrel of the gun the hunter can still shoot without having to use the Lazy Leg. Because the barrel clamp does not touch the vent rib it does not interfere with the shooters line of sight. The Lazy Leg can also be used on over and under shotguns.<br><br>Youth and Ladies - All fathers who have taken their children turkey hunting have faced the problem of the young hunter not being able to hold their gun up. The Lazy Leg solves this problem. Unlike with shooting sticks or a homemade rest the Lazy Leg is attached to the barrel of the gun so that when the hunter moves his rest moves with him.

The Special Edition stock improves on that feel with the addition of hardware that lets the user tailor the fit of the stock to make it perfect for one person or easy to adapt for a child as they grow.<br><br>There are four adjustments on this stock:<br><br>- First, the comb travels up and down allowing the shooter to set a comb height that allows your eye to line up with the middle of the crosshairs the same way every time, no matter how big your scope or how high your rings.<br>- Second, the length of pull is instantly adjustable from 13 1/4""-short enough to comfortably fit a child-to 15""-long enough to fit someone north of 6'6"".<br>- Third, the height of the buttpad is adjustable, allowing you to customize the stock to fit your neck dimensions and shooting style.<br>- Finally, the buttpad rotates, which lets you fit the buttpad into the ""pocket"" of your shoulder so that the gun mounts the same way every time.<br>- Use it for competition, use it for plinking, use it for hunting, use it to teach a young person how to shoot. No matter how you use Fajen's Legacy stock, know that you have the best design, the best adjustability, and the best of Fajen's stockmaking legacy.","129.99","86.93","Fajen","548-656","Firearm Accessories","Stocks Barrels & Barrel Acc","http://www.inventorysource.com/images/gs/t_GS43907.jpg","4.25","0.00","129.99","661120486565","","","Legacy Synthetic Stock -   Manufacture ID: 548-656    The first introduction in the new Legacy series is a ""Thumbhole Silhouette"" design for a heavy-barreled Ruger 10/22.

ShotCam combines four integrated technologies for additional situational awareness, accuracy, non-lethal surprise and intimidation and audio/video event/suspect/witness documentation. Most weapon deployments occur under low light. ShotCam delivers 120 lumens of bright white light to provide an officer the maximum in situational awareness, put blinding light on the suspect, and provide increased safety for innocent bystanders. Laser-targeting capability allows an officer full and total focus on the target without thought or worry about the front and rear sight focus and alignment. A laser focused on the perpetrator provides considerable intimidation. Video and audio documentation provides an officer the peace-of-mind that he can prove his story and dramatically reduce personal, departmental, and jurisdictional liability. ShotCam also provides valuable evidence leading to more convictions. Video and audio documentation also can assist in identifying and apprehending suspects who succeed in fleeing a scene. Removed from a weapon, the Shotcam can serve to provide video, still frames, and audio of a crime scene and witnesses. Documentation is saved in an encrypted manner to non-removable on-board memory which can be Mini-USB port downloaded only with a security password to assure evidence authenticity and proper evidence handling.<br><br>Features and Specifications:<br><br>- Ultra-bright LED Tactical Illuminator provides 3+ hours of 120 lumen bright white light.<br>- Laser Targeting System is class IIIa visible laser with windage and elevation adjustments.<br>- MPEG4 Camcorder with 30 minutes of password-secured VGA 640X480 video/audio at 30 frames per second. After 30 minutes of video is recorded, ShotCam automatically switches to Auto-Still mode and captures high resolution photos both manually and during a recoil event. The on-board memory is 512 megabytes which allows for over 30 minutes of video plus over 100 high resolution still images.<br>- 3.2 Megapixel Digital Camera (manual operation or automatic recoil-event activated)<br>- Frame mounted on any Picatinny-style or Weaver-style rail. Overall size is 3.1"" x 1.7"" x 1.2"". At only 5.5 ounces, does not interfere with a sidearm&rsquo;s cycling and handling characteristics.<br>- Advanced Power Management System yields up to 5 full days of standby mode and a minimum of 2.5 hours of continuous operation when all three modes are activated. Rechargeable battery and charger are included.<br>- Automatic-On Activation from a special holster, or can be operated manually while on or off of a weapon. Auto-On is activated by a magnet permanently embedded into a tactical holster.
