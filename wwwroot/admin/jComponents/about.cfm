		The jComponent set of ColdFusion custom tags was developed to provide ColdFusion developers
		with common interface elements made possible by CSS.  These elements include:
		<ol>
		  <li>jTab: The ever-popular tab interface.</li>
		  <li>jTree: A quick and easy to create tree.</li>
		  <li>jAccordian: An "accordian" interface that allows palettes to be shown/hidden at will.</li>
		  <li>jContainer: A box that shows/hides its content when its title bar is clicked.</li>
		</ol>
	  <p>
		The components were developed with the following in mind:
		<ol>
		  <li>Make them <strong>easy to use</strong>.</li>
		  <li>Allow the entire set to be <strong>quickly skinnable</strong></li>
		  <li>Make them cross-browser compatible, working on <strong>IE and Mozilla</strong>!</li>
		</ol>
